# Submission Guide for CCBP.tech / NxtWave

Congratulations on completing the **Automated Research Agent**! Here is how you can submit your project to the ccbp.tech platform.

## Checklist Before Submission

1.  **Code Pushed to GitHub**: Ensure your `main` branch is up to date (we just did this).
    *   Repo Link: `https://github.com/rkotesh/Automation-Researcher`
2.  **Project Deployed**: Ensure you have created the Service on Render and have a live "OnRender" URL.
    *   *If you haven't deployed yet, follow the `DEPLOYMENT.md` guide in this folder.*
3.  **Demo Ready**: Test your live URL to make sure it works.
    *   Open your Render URL (e.g., `https://automated-researcher-xyz.onrender.com`).
    *   Type a simple topic like "Apples".
    *   Verify it gives you a "Success" message and a Drive link.

## How to Submit on the Platform

1.  **Login**: Go to the [CCBP Platform](https://learning.ccbp.in/) or specific project submission portal.
2.  **Locate Project Card**: Find the card/assignment for "Build Your Own AI Agent" or the relevant Capstone project.

    *   **Description**: You can use the following description:
        > "I built an autonomous AI Research Agent using Python, LangGraph, and OpenAI. It takes a user's topic, uses a custom Google Search tool to find information, scrapes the content, and generates a professional briefing document. I also built a modern dark-themed web interface for it and integrated Google Drive for real-time document delivery."
